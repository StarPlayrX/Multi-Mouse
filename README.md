# Multi-Mouse | MM 1.0.3
## 🐭👾🖲️ Get Ready Player One!
Auto configures Trackball, Spinner, Mouse, Trackpad into one virtual device for Batocera with RetroArch
For Batocera v35 or later

MM is the magic solution for combining multiple mouse inputs into a single virtual device. Supports any combination of spinners trackball, mouse or trackpads. We made Multi-Mouse, so you can just play. Requires no editing. MM is designed to configure itself as one device.

Get ready player one. No hard encoded, hard to type event-mouse names. MM will hunt them down for you making the setup ultra easy. There's no editing after you swap out new mouse, trackball or spinner. No need to configure the mouse input for a single 1 player game.
 
Like Batocera, it's plug and play. Need to change your hardware configuration? Simply reboot or restart your game.
