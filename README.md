# Multi-Mouse (MM) 🐭👾🖲️
## For Batocera v35 or later

🚧🚧🚧 Version 1.0.2 is now under construction, please stand by 🚧🚧🚧

MM is the auto-magic solution for combining multiple mouse inputs into a single virtual device. Supports any number of event mice of 2 or more. Combines spinner, trackball, mouse, trackpad and other pointing devices. Requires no editing. Easy installation.

Get Ready Player One. No hard encoded, hard to type event-mouse names. MM will hunt them down for you. No editing after you swap out new mouse devices. No need to configure the mouse input for a single 1 player game.

Like Batocera, it's plug and play. Need to add or remove a usb mouse, trackball or spinner? Simply reboot or restart your game.

install.sh script will make it easy to move your devices to a clean install of Batocera.
